# **Football Data Analysis Using R**  

This project focuses on using **R** for **football data analysis and visualization**, aiming to place a data analyst at the center of strategic decisions in a football club. The study involves both **individual player analysis** and **team-wide performance evaluation**, providing valuable insights to optimize tactics.  

## **Key Analyses**  

### **1. Defensive Actions - Leandro Paredes (PSG)**  
![AnaliseDefensivaParedes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6816fc53-ca4e-4505-8b36-08a7b10503b6)

- Created **defensive action maps** to analyze how well Paredes covers key areas.  
- Used **Convex Hull** to highlight the areas where he was most effective defensively.  

### **2. Heatmap & Movement Analysis - Rodri (Man. City)**  
![RodriHeatMap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d23eb06f-8bb0-416c-89f7-0267167e9be1)

- Developed **heatmaps** to visualize Rodri's **high-activity zones** on the pitch.  
- Showcased his **defensive and central midfield influence** in a match against PSG.  

### **3. Dribbling Comparison - Messi vs. Sterling**

- Compared **successful vs. failed dribbles** for **Messi (PSG) and Sterling (Man. City)**.  
- Highlighted Messiâ€™s **100% dribble success rate**, compared to Sterlingâ€™s lower efficiency.  

### **4. Average Positioning - Man. City vs. PSG**

- Mapped **average player positions** for both teams.  
- Used **Convex Hull** to illustrate **positional structure and team shape**.  

### **5. Passing Analysis - Man. City vs. PSG**

![TopPassadores](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cbf5a8a-4b9c-47e0-8ad5-0ac4c65d8c1d)


- Created **pass maps** to identify strengths and weaknesses in ball circulation.  
- Visualized **successful vs. failed passes** and identified **key playmakers**.  

### **6. Expected Goals (xG) Analysis**

![MapaxG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5f3eb4d-9864-41fa-a27f-c82c4033937a)


- Built **xG progression charts** to track scoring opportunities over the match.  
- Mapped **xG values per shot**, providing insights into **goal-scoring efficiency**.  

## **Objectives & Impact**  
- Provides **data-driven tactical insights** to improve team performance.  
- Helps coaching staff understand **key player contributions**.  
- Enhances **football analytics using R** with well-documented scripts and visualizations.  

This project demonstrates how **data science can influence football strategy**, offering a structured, analytical approach to performance evaluation. ðŸš€âš½
